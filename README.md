# Alegria_SprintReview_and_Retrospective

To interprit the needs of the user, I would do several surveys with multiple users and create user stories based on those interactions. The user story is helpful to the development team because it gives the developer and tester a blue print of how the user would like the program to operate.

An agile proccess that I am excited to work in are the sprints. I like the lay out of this process and i like the free flow of information and the amount of communication involved. I think that the agile methodology is a great place to grow as a developer.

I believe that good team members are able to communicate well with the team and have a positive attitude. Communicating where they are at with a project and being willing to share when they are stuck is very valuable so that time is not wasted on one individual spinning their wheels to find a solution that another team member can help with or already has.
